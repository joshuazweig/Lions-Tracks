<h2>Introduction</h2>
The ultimate goal of this work is to provide researchers with massive amounts of data to assist in medical research.
This makes it of paramount importance in this project to provide an interface that is attractive and compels users to signup for and repeatedly use our service.
This motivated us to provide a robust interface for users to compare their data with the data of other members of the university community. This should cause users to repeatedly use the app for the fun and competition in comparing your individual data to others in the community.

<h2>Privacy</h2>
Of course there are great privacy implications anytime that health data is involved.
Privacy was the central concern throughout our design process.
For example, we used a keychain to store the users ID so that there is no way to look at the database and associate entries with a user.
In addition, we only store a random device ID in the keychain, with all health data stored anonymously on the database.
This makes it impossible to identify a user in anyway.

<h2>Researcher's Portal</h2>
As for the researcher’s side, they have a database portal through which they can download the data tables as csv (excel) Files.
Allowing researchers the raw data gives them the most freedom to gain insight into the statistics that they Find interesting.
That being said we give the researchers information on statistics regarding the database itself such as how frequently people are posting to the database and the types of data they are posting.
